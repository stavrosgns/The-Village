# The Village
## Story Overview
In a village of 10 residents, all of the sudden 2 individuals went missing in the last 3 months, two males.
John (2nd person of being missing) is an investigative reporter having his own blog who releases some scandals over the time.
One of them was the scandal with the *Company ABC* which tried to cover up the fact it was responsible for the water contamination
on *Long River* as the repeadedly ignored vital protocols and procedures in order to save money.
On the other hand, Nick is a farmerand is working in a laundry as part-time job.

A friend of John looking and asking around for a private investigator hired James who has the reputation of THE P.I on the field having
a vast skillset and mindset. In the beginning James was not interesting in the case, but when Nick, John's friend, explained the situation
and the pontential people who might be engaged in the case, something clicked in his mind that he wanted to investigate further.

James asks from Nick the permission to stay to John's house during the investigation in order to profile him and investigate the village further.
A request which granded by Nick. During James' investigation in John's house, he finds evidence that John was working on an article on drug dealing.
A phenomenal incedent for this rather quiet and picturesque village. Further analysis of data that was found on the John's laptop suggests that
he was about to go undercover.
